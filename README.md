For convenience, it is assumed that the zip file is downloaded on local directory for the script file to work on it. It's not necessary to unzip the file, the run_analysis will run with the zipfile name as argument(Default file name will be HARDataset).
Just simply provide the zipfile name and directory location, the script file will generate the tidy dataset , and will create the tidy_data.txt file at the end.
